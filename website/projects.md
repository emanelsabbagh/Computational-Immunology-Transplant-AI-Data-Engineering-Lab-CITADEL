# CITA Lab Projects

This page lists current and planned projects of the Computational Immunology and Transplant AI Lab.

## 1. Immune Trajectory Atlas After Pediatric HCT

**Goal:** Build a reproducible, multi-dataset immune trajectory atlas describing how T, B, NK, 
and myeloid cells recover after pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation.

**Key components:**
- Public scRNA-seq datasets (PBMC and bone marrow)
- Longitudinal immune composition analysis
- Pseudotime and trajectory modeling
- Visual “atlas” of early, intermediate, and late immune states

This is the flagship project of CITA Lab.

## 2. GVHD and Relapse Risk Modeling (Planned)

**Goal:** Develop calibrated, interpretable machine learning models that leverage immune and clinical 
features to predict acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, relapse, and non-relapse mortality.

**Focus:**
- Immune reconstitution curves (T, B, NK, mono)
- Baseline transplant variables
- Calibration and interpretability (e.g., SHAP)

## 3. TCR Repertoire and Immune Failure (Planned)

**Goal:** Characterize TCR diversity and clonality before and after HCT and explore associations 
with relapse, immune failure, and durable remission.

**Focus:**
- Public TCR datasets (iReceptor, AIRR-compliant repositories)
- Diversity indices and clonality
- Linking repertoire features with clinical outcomes

More projects will be added as the lab grows and collaborations develop.
