# Trajectory Analysis Notebooks

This folder contains notebooks for:

- Diffusion pseudotime (DPT)
- Slingshot
- Palantir
- RNA velocity (optional)
- Immune state transitions
- Visualization of early → late immune recovery states

These analyses support the Immune Trajectory Atlas and transplant immune dynamics research.
