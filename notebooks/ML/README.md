# Machine Learning Notebooks

This folder contains machine learning notebooks, including:

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Immune trajectory prediction models
- GVHD / relapse risk prediction
- Calibration (isotonic, Platt scaling)
- Interpretability tools (SHAP, feature importance)

All models are trained on public or synthetic data in this repository.
