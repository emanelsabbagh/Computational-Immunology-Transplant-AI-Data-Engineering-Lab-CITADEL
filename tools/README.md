# CITA Lab – Tools

This folder contains reusable helper functions, utilities, and pipelines developed by the CITA Lab.

These tools will support:

- scRNA-seq processing (Scanpy-based pipelines)
- TCR/BCR repertoire analysis
- Machine learning preprocessing and model utilities
- Visualization and plotting functions
- Data loaders for public datasets
- Quality control (QC) modules

As the lab grows, this folder will evolve into a structured Python package.
