# CITA Lab – Vision

Our long-term vision is to reconstruct, understand, and ultimately predict 
the human immune system after transplantation — cell by cell, gene by gene, 
trajectory by trajectory — and use these insights to transform survival, 
eliminate suffering, and redefine pediatric transplant medicine globally.

We aim to build a rigorous, reproducible, and ethically grounded program of 
computational immunology that can:

- Reveal how immune systems recover and fail after hematopoietic cell transplantation.
- Anticipate complications such as GVHD, relapse, viral reactivation, and immune failure.
- Translate these insights into practical tools that clinicians can use at the bedside.
- Extend the benefits of precision transplant medicine to children in all regions of the world.
