# CITA Lab – 5-Year Growth Plan 

This roadmap outlines the developmental stages of the Computational Immunology and Transplant AI Lab (CITA Lab), founded by Dr. Eman Elsabbagh. It includes scientific objectives, infrastructure building, collaborations, and the transition from a “virtual lab” to an established academic program.

---

## YEAR 1 — Foundations & Portfolio (2025–2026)

**Scientific:**
- Build the Immune Trajectory Atlas (public dataset version)
- Create basic scRNA-seq, TCR, and ML pipelines
- Complete 1–2 high-quality, fully reproducible public-dataset notebooks
- Submit 1 preprint (trajectory modeling OR GVHD prediction using public data)

**Infrastructure:**
- Launch CITA Lab GitHub + website
- Create formal lab identity (logo, pages, folders)
- Start “reusable tools” folder (utility scripts, plotting templates)

**Network:**
- Build small collaborator circle:
  - UPMC pathology (Alexanderani)
  - UPMC Transplant Immunology
  - Duke AI collaborators
  - 1–2 computational immunology contacts from Twitter/X

**Career Development:**
- Present early results at one conference (posters acceptable)
- Begin preparing for faculty applications with a computational focus

---

## YEAR 2 — Network Expansion & Method Development (2026–2027)

**Scientific:**
- Publish trajectory atlas (public version)
- Start TCR repertoire + ML relapse modeling (public datasets)
- Develop at least one novel computational method:
  - immune reconstitution curve modeling  
  - calibrated ML for GVHD  

**Infrastructure:**
- Add contributors (students, interns, collaborators)
- Grow tools folder → simple Python package
- Add automated workflows (Snakemake or lightweight scripts)

**Network:**
- Start collaborations with:
  - one pathology lab
  - one BMT team
  - one computational immunology group globally

**Career:**
- Submit a major computational transplant abstract to ASH / ASTCT
- Begin IRB discussions if part of an institution

---

## YEAR 3 — Transition Toward Institutional Lab (2027–2028)

**Scientific:**
- Begin IRB-approved analyses (if in institutional role)
- Build a small immune reconstruction dataset (institutional)
- Publish a methods paper

**Infrastructure:**
- Convert tools into a light-weight Python package:
  - `cita-immunotools`

**Network:**
- Multi-site immune recovery project begins (2–3 centers)
- Co-supervise a student or fellow

**Career:**
- Apply for faculty or senior scientist roles with:
  - strong GitHub  
  - preprints  
  - CITA Lab identity  
  - public projects  
- Give invited talks

---

## YEARS 4–5 — Early Faculty Phase & Expansion (2028–2030)

**Scientific:**
- Lead multi-center computational transplant projects
- IRB + multi-site immune trajectory dataset (pediatric)
- Model immune failure, relapse, GVHD with:
  - single-cell data  
  - TCR data  
  - ML models  
  - causal inference tools  

**Infrastructure:**
- Formal CITA Lab recognition at your institution
- Recruit (officially):
  - 1 student
  - 1 data analyst
  - 1 clinical collaborator team
- Build a biobank pipeline if institution allows

**Network:**
- Become known in computational immunology + pediatric BMT
- Participate in global transplant AI collaborations

**Career:**
- PI on grants
- Aim for high-impact papers
- Position lab for long-term leadership and global impact
